## <img src="images/logos/face.png" height="40"> GLaMM Overview

Grounding Large Multimodal Model (GLaMM) is an end-to-end trained LMM which provides visual grounding capabilities with the flexibility to process both image and region inputs. This enables the new unified task of Grounded Conversation Generation that combines phrase grounding, referring expression segmentation, and vision-language conversations. Equipped with the capability for detailed region understanding, pixel-level groundings, and conversational abilities, GLaMM offers a versatile capability to interact with visual inputs provided by the user at multiple granularity levels.

---

## 🏆 Contributions

- **GLaMM Introduction.** We present the Grounding Large Multimodal Model (GLaMM), the first-of-its-kind model capable of generating natural language responses that are seamlessly integrated with object segmentation masks.

- **Novel Task & Evaluation.** We propose a new task of Grounded Conversation Generation (GCG). We also introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol for this task.

- **GranD Dataset Creation.** We create the GranD - Grounding-anything Dataset, a large-scale densely annotated dataset with 7.5M unique concepts grounded in 810M regions.
